# PepeBitcoin (PBTC)

**PepeBitcoin (PBTC)** is a utility-focused crypto ecosystem built on **Base**.  
Originally launched as a meme token on another L2, PBTC has since relaunched with a clear vision: to empower token creators with flexible, scalable tools — without requiring a developer.

## 🔧 What We're Building

PBTC is more than just a token. It’s the foundation for a growing ecosystem of tools and services:

### 🟢 Token Forge *(in development)*
A customizable, no-code token launchpad for meme coins and serious projects alike:
- Optional team/dev allocations with vesting
- Built-in liquidity lock options
- Optional whale protection settings
- Clean UX for both buyers and project creators

### 🛍️ Merch Platform *(in development)*
A print-on-demand system for token projects to offer branded merch with zero overhead.  
Creators upload designs, we handle fulfillment, and they earn per sale.

### 💳 Payment Gateway *(in development)*
A lightweight crypto payment system for websites and online stores.  
Accept tokens from the PBTC ecosystem — payments auto-convert to USDT for merchants.
