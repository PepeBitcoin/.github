# PepeBitcoin (PBTC)

**PepeBitcoin (PBTC)** is a utility-focused crypto ecosystem built on **Base**.  
Originally launched as a meme token on another L2, PBTC has since relaunched with a clear vision: to empower token creators with flexible, scalable tools — without requiring a developer.

## 🔧 What We're Building

PBTC is more than just a token. It’s the foundation for a growing ecosystem of tools and services:

### 🟢 Token Forge
A customizable, no-code token launchpad for meme coins and serious projects alike:
- Optional team/dev allocations with vesting
- Built-in liquidity lock options
- Optional whale protection settings
- Clean UX for both buyers and project creators  

Additional features are under active development.

### 🛍️ Merch Platform
Our first merch store is live, offering PBTC and crypto-themed designs.  
The next phase — planned for **Q4 2025** — is a fully integrated print-on-demand platform where token creators can publish merch for their own communities. This will connect directly with the PBTC payment gateway.

### 💳 Payment Gateway *(planned Q4 2025)*
A lightweight crypto payment system for websites and online stores.  
It will first power the integrated Merch Platform, and later be available for other projects to embed and use.  
Payments auto-convert to USDT for merchants.
